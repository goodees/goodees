/**
 * Common logic for facade to speaking with entities. It instantiates the entities, recovers their state, manages their snapshots
 * and invocation lifecycle. In order for recovery to work, the runtime needs {@link EventLog} to see the past events,
 * and {@link SnapshotStore} for storing the snapshots. Entities will then need to be created with an {@link EventStore}
 * that uses as is consistent with the EventLog.
 * <p>This class does not prescribe any specific execution and dispatching methods, this is left to subclasses.</p>
